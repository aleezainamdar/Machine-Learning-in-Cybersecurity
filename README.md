# Machine-Learning-in-Cybersecurity

Recent advances in Machine Learning have led to strong performance in a wide range of tasks which led to a wide spread deployement roll out of such systems. ChatGPT and CoPilots for code and office applications just being a few prominent examples. In terms of privacy and security, this is a double-edged sword. ML techniques can be used to efficiently detect and prevent attacks (e.g., intrusion detection). However, their deployment to many real-world sensitive systems (e.g., self-driving cars, the cloud) also makes them susceptible to numerous attacks. As AI and ML becomes part of our IT infrastructure, we have to know and defend against cybersecurity threats.
